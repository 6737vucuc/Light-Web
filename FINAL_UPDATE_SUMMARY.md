## 🎯 How Voice Calls Work Now

### Making a Call (Outgoing)
1. User clicks phone icon next to friend's name
2. **Ringing sound starts playing** (loops)
3. Call request sent to server
4. LiveKit room created
5. Waiting for other user to accept
6. When accepted: ringing stops, call starts, timer begins

### Receiving a Call (Incoming)
1. Server detects incoming call (polling every 2 seconds)
2. **Notification sound starts playing** (loops)
3. **Beautiful popup appears** with:
   - Animated phone icon
   - Caller's name
   - Accept/Reject buttons
4. **Browser notification** shows (if permission granted)
5. User accepts or rejects
6. Sound stops, popup closes
7. If accepted: call starts, timer begins

### During Call
- ✅ Mute/Unmute microphone
- ✅ See call duration timer
- ✅ End call button
- ✅ High-quality audio
- ✅ Visual overlay showing call status

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Vercel

Go to Vercel Dashboard > Your Project > Settings > Environment Variables

Add these **3 LiveKit variables**:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=wss://light-of-life-hmc6y7lv.livekit.cloud
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=APIKpzsAfMt3dqH
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=cvNeyXRTJZH1pnDnCXeYfDXrr2VIN8VbO1UKHOnTofkD
```

Make sure all other environment variables are also set:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `MESSAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASS`
- `PUSHER_*` variables
- `IPINFO_API_KEY`

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
# The code is already committed locally
# Just need to push to GitHub

git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Vercel Auto-Deploy

If your Vercel project is connected to GitHub, it will automatically deploy when you push.

### Step 4: Test Voice Calls

1. Open your deployed app
2. Login with two different accounts (different browsers/devices)
3. Add each other as friends
4. Go to **Public Feed** (Friends & Messaging is now inside it)
5. Click the phone icon to start a call
6. On the other device, accept the incoming call popup
7. Enjoy crystal-clear voice calls! 🎉
