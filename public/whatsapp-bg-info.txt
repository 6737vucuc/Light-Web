# WhatsApp Background

To add the WhatsApp background pattern, you can:

1. Download the official WhatsApp background from:
   https://web.whatsapp.com/img/bg-chat-tile-light_686b98c9fdffef3f63127759e2057750.png

2. Or create a simple pattern using CSS:
   - Light gray with subtle pattern
   - Color: #efeae2

The background is already set in the WhatsAppMessenger component.
If you want to use an actual image, save it as /public/whatsapp-bg.png
